Instructions for running code

The following python libraries were used: numpy, cv2, time, and sys.

The environment for running the code uses the same anaconda environment for the previous assignments in this class

If you do not have the environment already created, then run the following command:

conda env create -f cs6475.yml

Then activate the environment by running the following command:

source activate CS6475

To run all of the seam carving replications, run the following command:

python main.py all

The program takes roughly 330 seconds to complete on my macbook pro.

To generate the comparison images, run the following command:

python main.py diff

All of the artifacts will be under a directory associated to their image name.
